        <h1>What is an Asteroid Belt?</h1>
        <div id="roundeddiv">
            <p>
                The asteroid belt is a torus-shaped region in the Solar System, located roughly between the orbits of
                the planets Jupiter and Mars, that is occupied by a great many solid, irregularly shaped bodies, of many
                sizes but much smaller than planets, called <b>asteroids or minor planets</b>.
            </p>
        </div>

            <img src="../images/Asteroid-Belts.jpg" class="imgcenter">
        </center>
        <div style="padding-left:20px;padding-right:20px;text-align: justify;">
            <p>

                The asteroid belt contains asteroids
                of all different sizes, but there are four that are the largest: Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea. These
                four asteroids contain half of the mass that is in the entire asteroid belt.
            </p>
            <h1>How Far Away Is The Asteroid Belt?</h1>
            <p>The asteroid belt is between the planets Mars and Jupiter. It is located about 2.2 to 3.2 Astronomical
                Units (AU) from the Sun. That is somewhere between 329-478 million km away.
            </p>
            <p>
                The asteroid belt is huge and the space between each of the asteroids is over 600,000 miles. The
                circumference of Earth is only 24,901.45 miles, which means that the distance between objects in the
                asteroid belt is more than 24 times the circumference of Earth.
            </p>

            <h3>FUN FACTS</h3>
            # 1. The asteroid belt was first discovered in 1801.
            <br>
            # 2. The asteroid belt is a disc shape, located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.
            <br>
            # 3. Gravitational forces can throw asteroids out of the belt and send them towards the inner solar system.
            Asteroids are similar to comets but lack the coma which appears as a tail.<br>
            # 4. Sometimes the asteroid belt is called the main belt to help differentiate between other groups of
            asteroids in the solar system.
