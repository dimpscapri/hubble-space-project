  <h1>FACTS ABOUT HUBBLE</h1>
  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Are the colors in Hubble images real?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>There are no natural color cameras aboard Hubble and there never have been. The optical cameras on board have
      all been digital CCD cameras, which take images as grayscale pixels but use colored filters to isolate
      different colors in each image.
      <br><br>
      Sometimes the color in the images is as natural as possible. However, the color given to the images is not
      just artistic embellishment. The images are, indeed, downloaded as black and white, and color is added for a
      number of different reasons — for example, to show the location of chemical elements and highlight features
      so subdued that the human eye cannot see them.
      <br><br>
    </p>
  </div>
  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Can Hubble see Appolo landing site on moon?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>No, Hubble cannot take photos of the Apollo landing sites. An object on the Moon, even the size of a large
      house, is too small to resolve. So, anything we left on the Moon cannot be resolved in any Hubble image. It
      would just appear as a dot blended with its surroundings.</p>
  </div>
  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Can Hubble take picture of the Earth?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>The surface of the Earth is whizzing by as Hubble orbits, and the pointing system, designed to track the
      distant stars, cannot track an object on the Earth. The shortest exposure time on any of the Hubble
      instruments is 0.1 seconds, and in this time Hubble moves almost half a mile, about 700 meters. A picture
      Hubble took of Earth would be completely streaked.</p>
  </div>
  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Can we see live pictures from Hubble?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>While there is no “real time” camera or webcam on board the telescope for live relay links, you can find out
      what Hubble is observing at any time by visiting <a href="http://spacetelescopelive.org/" target="_blank">Space
        Telescope Live</a>. Usually, Hubble is looking at these
      targets for the first time, so the images you will see there are from other telescopes, but give you an idea
      of where Hubble is looking.
      <br><br>
      The images that Hubble takes are digital pictures and spectra that are generally released to the public
      after six months (to allow the investigators time to do their research). The data, which are transmitted
      from the telescope in digital form, need to be converted from this digitized information by computers into
      black-and-white photos. These are then enhanced to discern details in the images.</p>
  </div>
  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Are all Hubble data available is public?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Yes … eventually! Astronomers who requested the data generally have six months to publish their findings
      before the data are publicly released.
      <br><br>
      After new instruments were installed during servicing missions to Hubble, early release observations were
      very quickly made public. These photos showed the world that the instruments were meeting expectations.
      <br><br>
      Hubble images produced by the Space Telescope Science Institute are covered by copyright law. This copyright
      covers most images displayed on all of our websites. NASA holds worldwide copyright on publicly released
      Hubble images, which means they are in the public domain and free of charge to use. All Hubble data becomes
      non-proprietary after six months, and its archive can be freely accessed by anyone. However, the images
      cannot be used to imply any endorsement of a person or product by NASA.</p>
