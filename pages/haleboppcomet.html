      <h1>What Is the Hale-Bopp Commet?</h1>
      <div id="roundeddiv">
        <p>
          Comet Hale–Bopp (formally designated C/1995 O1) is a comet that was
          perhaps the most widely observed of the 20th century, and one of the
          brightest seen for many decades.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hale–Bopp was discovered on July 23, 1995 separately by Alan Hale and
          Thomas Bopp prior to it becoming naked-eye visible on Earth. Although
          predicting the maximum apparent brightness of new comets with any
          degree of certainty is difficult, Hale–Bopp met or exceeded most
          predictions in April 1, 1997. It was visible to the naked eye for a
          record 18 months, twice as long as the previous record holder, the
          Great Comet of 1811. Accordingly, Hale–Bopp was dubbed the Great Comet
          of 1997.

        <p>
          The comet was discovered independently on July 23, 1995 by two
          observers, Alan Hale and Thomas Bopp, both in the United States.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hale had spent many hundreds of hours searching for comets without
          success, and was tracking known comets from his driveway in New Mexico
          when he chanced upon Hale–Bopp just after midnight. Once he had
          established that the object was moving relative to the background
          stars, he emailed the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams, the
          clearing house for astronomical discoveries.
        </p>

        <p>
          Bopp did not own a telescope. He was out with friends near Stanfield,
          Arizona observing star clusters and galaxies when he chanced across
          the comet while at the eyepiece of his friend's telescope. He realized
          he might have spotted something new when, like Hale, he checked his
          star maps to determine if any other deep-sky objects were known to be
          near M70, and found that there were none. The following morning, it
          was confirmed that this was a new comet.

          The planets range from small to giant rocky planets – and from small
          to giant gas planets. We are finding more and more of these types of
          planets every day and how they exist through various different space
          missions.

          <h3>FUN FACTS</h3>
          # 1. Hale-Bopp has a very large nucleus.
          <br />
          # 2. It could be seen in the sky for a record 19 months — from May
          1996 to November 1997 — and was visible through the bright skies of
          cities.
          <br />
          # 3. It has a highly elongated orbit that takes it very close to the
          Sun and then flings it out into the outer solar system, well past the
          orbit of Pluto.
          <br />
          # 4. Hubble orbits the Earth at a cruising speed of 17,000 miles per
          hour, and takes 15 minutes to rotate 90 degrees.
          <br />
          # 5. Scientists found lots of organic chemicals in Hale-Bopp which
          they never saw before.
