      <h1>What is an Exoplanet?</h1>
      <div id="roundeddiv">
        <p>
          All of the planets in our solar system orbit around the Sun. Planets
          that orbit around other stars are called <b>exoplanets</b>. Exoplanets
          are very hard to see directly with telescopes. They are hidden by the
          bright glare of the stars they orbit. So, astronomers use other ways
          to detect and study these distant planets. They search for exoplanets
          by looking at the effects these planets have on the stars they orbit.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div style="padding-left:20px;padding-right:20px;text-align: justify;">      <p>
       
        <img class="imgright" src="../images/Kepler-452b.png" width="20%"> More and more exoplanets are being discovered every year. But believe it
        or not the first known exoplanets were only discovered about 25 years
        ago. Before then, we thought that only the planets in the solar system
        existed.
      </p>
      <p>
        While scientists would have always kind of guessed that there were other
        planets in the universe, it was only confirmed a short time ago through
        technology. Isn’t technology amazing!
      </p>

      <p>
        Now we currently know that there are over 1,000 planets that exist
        outside of our solar system, with more and more exoplanets being
        discovered all the time. There are different types of exoplanets just
        like the different planets in our solar system.
      </p>

      <p>
        The planets range from small to giant rocky planets – and from small to
        giant gas planets. We are finding more and more of these types of
        planets every day and how they exist through various different space
        missions.
      </p>

      <p>
        The number of planets that could exist in our universe like the stars is
        limitless. So the answer to how many exoplanets that could be is like
        answer how many stars are there? The answer is infinite!
      </p>

      <p>
        The hope is to one day find life on one these exoplanets in our galaxy
        or beyond. And that will then change everything for everyone forever.
      </p>

      <p>
        Scientists are working on and theorizing all the time how we as humans
        can achieve this and finally find life of better still intelligent life
        in the universe. It could be found anywhere really, however it’s more
        likely that one of the exoplanets is the best bet.

   <h3>FUN FACTS</h3>
  # 1. The Kepler mission is the main mission to discover exoplanets. 
<br>
  # 2. Scientists estimate that 1 in 5 Earth like stars could have at least 1 Earth like planet in its orbit.
  <br>
  # 3. Currently there are no Exoplanets discovered outside of our Galaxy.<br>
