      <h1>What Is the Dwarf Planets?</h1>
      <div id="roundeddiv">
        <p>
          Dwarf planets are what you think they are. They are small rocky body’s
          that orbit the sun in our solar system. There are 5 officially
          recognised dwarf planets in the solar system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dwarf planets are the same as normal planets, just smaller. There are
          other differences between planets and dwarf planets, with the main one
          being that dwarf planets have not cleared other objects in the area
          that they orbit.

          the sun and then outwards.

            Kuiper belt. Ceres is a very rocky planet with mysterious spots

            is Haumea that it completely turns on its axis every 4 hours.

    There should be millions upon millions of dwarf planets similar to the dwarfs outside of the solar system,  however we just haven’t found them yet with current technology. We know that there are many extra solar system planets that are normal sized planets that have already been discovered, and we think that there are also endless amounts of these planets orbiting stars in the universe. These extra solar system planets are called ‘Exoplanets’. We will definitely discover millions of dwarf planets and exoplanets in the future.

          <h3>FUN FACTS</h3>
          # 1. There are many more dwarf planets in the solar system awaiting confirmation.
          <br />
          # 2. Dwarf planets are different to satellites. (moons)

          <br />
          # 3. Ceres was discovered by astronomer Giuseppe Piazza in 1801.
          <br />
          # 4. Pluto was discovered by astronomer Clyde W. Tombaugh in 1930.
          <br />
          # 5. Haumea was discovered by a team of scientists in 2004.
          <br />
          # 6.  Makemake was discovered by a team of scientists in 2005.
          <br />
          # 7. Eris was discovered by a team of scientists in 2005.
