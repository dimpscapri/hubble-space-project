      <h1>What Is the Hubble Space Telescope?</h1>
      <div id="roundeddiv">
        <p>
          The Hubble Space Telescope is a large telescope in space. NASA
          launched Hubble in 1990. Hubble is as long as a large school bus. It
          weighs as much as two adult elephants. Hubble travels around Earth at
          about 5 miles per second. That is as fast as driving a car from the
          East Coast of the United States to the West Coast in 10 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hubble faces toward space. It takes pictures of planets, stars and
          galaxies. Hubble has seen stars being born. Hubble has seen stars die.
          It has seen galaxies that are trillions of miles away. Hubble also has
          seen comet pieces crash into the gases above Jupiter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scientists have learned a lot about space from Hubble pictures. The
          pictures are beautiful to look at too.

          The HST is named after Edwin Hubble (1889–1953), one of the great
          pioneers of modern astronomy. At its heart are a 2.4 m primary mirror
          and five science instruments that study the Universe in infrared,
          visible or ultraviolet light. Light collected by the main mirror is
          reflected onto a smaller mirror and then sent to the instruments. The
          data are then sent to Earth via a relay satellite.
        </p>
        <p>
          Power for the observatory is provided by two large (2.6 x 7.1 m) solar
          panels. Fine Guidance Sensors are used to lock onto guide stars. This
          ensures the extremely high pointing accuracy needed to make very
          accurate observations.
        </p>

        <p>
          Hubble is the only telescope ever designed to be serviced in space by
          astronauts, so that old instruments can be replaced. This proved to be
          invaluable when the first images were blurred and a special optical
          system had to be installed to correct the problem in 1993. There have
          been five servicing missions, the last occurring in May 2009. It is
          expected to continue operating until 2014.

        <p>
          The planets range from small to giant rocky planets – and from small
          to giant gas planets. We are finding more and more of these types of
          planets every day and how they exist through various different space
          missions.

          <h3>FUN FACTS</h3>
          # 1. Hubble Space Telescope is about the size of a large school bus.
            <br>
            # 2. It weighs 24,500 pounds. That’s just under two adult male African bush elephants.
          <br>
          # 3. Hubble gathers energy from the sun using two 25-foot solar panels. It requires much less power than one might think, averaging 2,100 watts of power usage. A hair dryer requires about 1,800 watts.
          <br>
          # 4. Hubble orbits the Earth at a cruising speed of 17,000 miles per hour, and takes 15 minutes to rotate 90 degrees.
          <br>
          # 5. Hubble has observed locations more than 13.4 billion light years away, meaning it has seen light that existed in the universe 13.4 billion years ago.
          <br>
          # 6. Astronomers using Hubble data have published more than 13,000 journal articles, making it one of the most productive scientific instruments ever built.
