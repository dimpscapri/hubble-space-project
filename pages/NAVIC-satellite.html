            <div id="roundeddiv">

                <p>
                    The Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System, with an operational name of NavIC, is an autonomous
                    regional satellite navigation system that provides accurate real-time positioning and timing
                    services. It covers India and a region extending 1,500 km around it, with plans for further
                    extension.</p>

            <div style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; text-align: justify">

                <p>

                <h1>Why it has been built?</h1>
                <img class="imgright" src="../images/IRNSS.jpg"> When Pakistani troops took positions in
                Kargil in 1999, one of the first things Indian military sought
                was the global positioning system (GPS) data for the region. The space-based navigation system
                maintained by the US government would have provided vital information, but the US denied it to India. A
                need for an indigenous satellite navigation system was felt earlier, but the Kargil experience made the
                nation realise its importance.

                </p>
                <h1>When it was announced?</h1>
                <p>TThe satellite system was first announced in 2007 and was meant to be fully functional by 2012 but it
                    did not happen due to various constraints. The first of the seven satellite was sent into orbit in
                    2013.


                </p>
                <h1>What it is meant for? </h1>
                <p>According to the ISRO, the IRNSS was developed for terrestrial, aerial and marine navigation,
                    disaster management, vehicle tracking and fleet management and integration with mobile phones. It
                    would provide Standard Positioning Service (SPS) to all users and Restricted Service (RS), which is
                    an encrypted service for only authorised users. It was made mandatory for all commercial vehicles in
                    India in 2019.
                </p>
                <h1>How accurate is it? </h1>
                <p>
                    With seven satellites, NavIC is considered to be at par with US-based GPS, Russia's Glonass and
                    Galileo developed by Europe. The IRNSS is expected to provide a position accuracy of better than 20
                    metre in the primary service area. On the other hand, 24-satellite based GPS enabled smartphones can
                    be accurate to within a 4.9 meter radius. The accuracy will though worsen near buildings, bridges
                    and trees. Cloud cover also impacts GPS' accuracy. In some GPS receivers, the accuracy can be as
                    good as 11.8 inches. However, it is being said that the NavIC system uses S and L bands, unlike GPS
                    which uses only L band. This, as per reports, helps NavIC to be more accurate than GPS.

            <h3>FUN FACTS</h3>
            # 1. India, the Fifth Country to own its Own Navigation System.
            <br />
            # 2. India's Prime Minister, Mr. Narendra Modi named the system as NAVIC, translated as mariners, dedicating
            it to the mariners and fishermen of the country.

            <br />
            # 3. Mr. Modi offered NAVIC's services to all the SAARC nations and India's neighbouring nations as well.
            India currently has seven countries that rely on other countries for their navigational needs.
            <br />
            # 4. ISRO officials stated that the IRNSS satellites reached a total cost of Rs. 1,420 crore.
