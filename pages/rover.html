                    A rover is a vehicle that travels on the ground of a planet, moon, or other astronomical object.
                    Some rovers carry people that drive them. Most are robots that can drive themselves for short
                    distances, but humans on Earth give them directions each day about where to go and what to do. They
                    are electric vehicles, either using solar power or nuclear power.

            <h1>ROVERS ON MARS</h1>
            <p>
                The only rovers to successfully land on Mars were sent there by NASA. They have special equipment on
                arms
                for testing the soil, taking pictures and doing other planetary science.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Sojourner rover</b> - The first Mars rover, this was a test vehicle to see if a solar vehicle
                    would work on
                    Mars. It landed on July 4th, 1997 and lasted nearly three months.</li>
                <li> <b>Spirit rover </b>- Spirit and Opportunity were launched as a pair. Spirit landed January 4, 2004
                    and lasted
                    a little over six years.</li>
                <li> <b>Opportunity rover</b> - Landed January 25, 2004 and is still working.</li>
                <li> <b>Curiosity rover</b> - A nuclear-powered rover, landed August, 2012 and is still going.</li>

            <p>
                The lunar roving vehicle (LRV) transported two astronauts on exploration traverses on the Moon during
                the Apollo 15, 16, and 17 missions. The LRV carried tools, scientific equipment, communications gear,
                and lunar samples.

                The four-wheel, lightweight vehicle greatly extended the lunar area that could be explored by humans.
                The LRV could be operated by either astronaut.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Lunokhod </b>Sent by the Soviet Union, Lunokhod 1 was the first remote-controlled vehicle sent
                    off the Earth.
                </li>
                <li> <b>Apollo Lunar Roving Vehicle</b>, also called a moon buggy, sent by NASA during the Apollo
                    program, it was driven by astronauts.</li>

            <h3>FUN FACTS</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Rovers have to withstand high levels of acceleration, high and low temperatures, pressure, dust,
                    corrosion, cosmic rays, remaining functional without repair for a needed period of time.</li>

                <li>Other rover designs that do not use wheeled approaches are possible. Mechanisms that utilize "walking" on robotic legs, hopping, rolling, etc. are possible.</li>

                <li>Rovers which land on celestial bodies far from the Earth, such as the Mars Exploration Rovers,
                    cannot be remotely controlled in real-time since the speed at which radio signals travel is far too
                    slow for real-time or near-real-time communication. </li>

            </ol>
