          A galaxy is a huge collection of gas, dust, and billions of stars and their solar systems, all held together by gravity.
                </p>
                <p>We live on a planet called Earth that is part of our solar system. But where is our solar system? It’s a small part of the Milky Way Galaxy.

                  A galaxy is a huge collection of gas, dust, and  of stars and their solar systems. A galaxy is held together by gravity. Our galaxy, the Milky Way, also has a  in the middle.</p>

          When you look up at stars in the night sky, you’re seeing other stars in the Milky Way. If it’s really dark, far away from lights from cities and houses, you can even see the dusty bands of the Milky Way stretch across the sky.


        </p>
         
          <p>There are many galaxies besides ours, though. There are so many, we can’t even count them all yet! The  looked at a small patch of space for 12 days and found 10,000 galaxies, of all sizes, shapes, and colors. Some scientists think there could be as many as  galaxies in the universe.

            There are four main types of galaxies depending on their shape:

          <h3>FUN FACTS</h3>
          # 1. The word galaxy comes from the Greek word for "milky".
          <br />
          # 2. Some scientists think that most of the mass of a galaxy is made up of a mysterious substance called dark matter.

          <br />
          # 3. It is thought that there is a massive black hole in the center of galaxies.
          <br />
          # 4. The closest galaxy to the Milky Way is Andromeda, which is around 2.6 million light years away from us.
          <br>
          # 5. Many galaxies are more than 100,000 light years across in distance.
          <br>
          # 6. It takes over two hundred million years for the sun to orbit the center of the galaxy. This is called a galactic year.
